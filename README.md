# vscode-settings
Custom settings to minimize visual clutter and create a minimalist look in VSCode.
To access the full interface, youâ€™ll need to install the required fonts and the customize-css-loader extension in VSCode. [[https://github.com/drcika/apc-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)]

###Updated (Dec. 2024)
Due to Apc Customize UI ++ discontinuation, i switched to custom-css-js-loader, to apply some fonts and spacing changes into the VSCode interface.
The needed files are the .css and .js as well. Update the file location with ur preferences in the settings.json file at the bottom.

### Updated (Oct. 2024)
Custom Apc settings not working now.
